# Bible in Minecraft

This datapack for Vanilla Minecraft 1.14 is the perfect addition to your Christian Minecraft server. It enables you to read the entire James King Bible in-game.

### Usage

After installing the datapack type `/function bible:getwordofgod` in the chat and you will be given a Written Book called "Holy Bible". This book contains a list of all chapters of the old and new testament. Clicking a chapter will give you a chest containing the entire chapter.

Since books in Minecraft have a page limit most of the chapters are split into two or more volumes.
