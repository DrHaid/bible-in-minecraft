\"}","{\"text\":\"1:6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: \"}","{\"text\":\"1:7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; \"}","{\"text\":\"1:10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; \"}","{\"text\":\"1:13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; \"}","{\"text\":\"1:14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: \"}","{\"text\":\"1:16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: \"}","{\"text\":\"1:17 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, \"}","{\"text\":\"1:20 According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:22 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: \"}","{\"text\":\"1:24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.  \"}","{\"text\":\"1:25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

\"}","{\"text\":\"1:30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, \"}","{\"text\":\"2:2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: \"}","{\"text\":\"2:6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: \"}","{\"text\":\"2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: \"}","{\"text\":\"2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: \"}","{\"text\":\"2:10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; \"}","{\"text\":\"2:11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings: \"}","{\"text\":\"2:15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.  \"}","{\"text\":\"2:29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: \"}","{\"text\":\"2:30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.  \"}","{\"text\":\"3:1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.  \"}","{\"text\":\"3:2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.  \"}","{\"text\":\"3:3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.  \"}","{\"text\":\"3:4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh.
