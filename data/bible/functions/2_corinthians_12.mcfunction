I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."}','{"text":"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven."}','{"text":"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)"}','{"text":"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."}','{"text":"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities."}','{"text":"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me."}','{"text":"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."}','{"text":"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me."}','{"text":"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."}','{"text":"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."}','{"text":"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing."}','{"text":"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."}','{"text":"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."}','{"text":"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."}','{"text":"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."}','{"text":"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."}','{"text":"Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?"}','{"text":"I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?"}','{"text":"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."}','{"text":"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:"}','{"text":"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."}']}
