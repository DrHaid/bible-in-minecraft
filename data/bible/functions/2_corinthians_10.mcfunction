If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s."}','{"text":"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"}','{"text":"That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters."}','{"text":"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."}','{"text":"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present."}','{"text":"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."}','{"text":"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."}','{"text":"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:"}','{"text":"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"}','{"text":"To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand."}','{"text":"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."}','{"text":"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."}']}
