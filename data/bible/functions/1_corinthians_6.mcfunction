Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"}','{"text":"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."}','{"text":"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?"}','{"text":"Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren."}','{"text":"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"}','{"text":"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."}','{"text":"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."}','{"text":"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."}','{"text":"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."}','{"text":"And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."}','{"text":"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."}','{"text":"What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh."}','{"text":"But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."}','{"text":"Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body."}','{"text":"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"}','{"text":"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s."}']}
