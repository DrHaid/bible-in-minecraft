Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."}','{"text":"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead."}','{"text":"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."}','{"text":"And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death."}','{"text":"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."}','{"text":"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."}','{"text":"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."}','{"text":"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."}','{"text":"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."}','{"text":"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."}','{"text":"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."}','{"text":"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not."}','{"text":"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."}','{"text":"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."}','{"text":"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."}','{"text":"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:"}','{"text":"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."}','{"text":"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"}','{"text":"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."}']}
