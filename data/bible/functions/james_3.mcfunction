Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"}','{"text":"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."}','{"text":"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:"}','{"text":"But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."}','{"text":"Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."}','{"text":"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.
