But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."}','{"text":"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."}','{"text":"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"}','{"text":"And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"}','{"text":"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily."}','{"text":"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."}','{"text":"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."}','{"text":"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."}','{"text":"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"}','{"text":"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:"}','{"text":"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:"}','{"text":"But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body."}','{"text":"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds."}','{"text":"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."}','{"text":"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."}','{"text":"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:"}','{"text":"It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:"}','{"text":"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."}','{"text":"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."}','{"text":"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."}','{"text":"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven."}','{"text":"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."}','{"text":"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."}','{"text":"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."}','{"text":"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"}','{"text":"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."}','{"text":"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."}','{"text":"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."}','{"text":"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"}','{"text":"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."}','{"text":"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."}','{"text":"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."}']}
